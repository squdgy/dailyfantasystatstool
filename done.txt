deleted load_db and updated update_db to be able to load a full season and to delete game info before re-importing
doubleheader rework:
- changed load_schedule to: use merge into, not re-generate game ids from scratch, update idmapping table with mlb game ids

- added a double header order to the schedule table: 0 = not double header, 1 = game 1 of dh, 2 = game 2 of dh
