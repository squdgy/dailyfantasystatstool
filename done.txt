Restart 1/27/2014
changed theme
'finished' multi-column sort, ui & server-side
minor text and css changes
apply upgrade to extjs 4.2.1
tighten security in perl by separating username/password from connection string so they don't get output on errors
fixed 4.2.1 bug: bottom grid didn't update on site change
figure out why nhl projections not working : commented out something I shouldn't have
apply webconfig transform to allow debugging locally without azure diagnostics - decided to not do this and to add in global.asax instead
FOR POSITION SCHEMA CHANGE: - DONE!!
(Change entire position mapping to be more closely aligned with the way sites do it. multiple position eligibility)
- new table 1->many player-dfsposition: done, dfsplayerrosterpositioneligibility
- new table 2: dfsrosterpositionmap, maps site's player position names to their roster position ids (as defined by us)
- populated dfsrosterpositionmap for dd nba, dk nba/nhl, fd nba/nhl; still need to do other sites/sports
- dfsrosterpositionmap todo: dd nba/ff nba/ff nhl : done
- scrapers/postprocess need to store all positions player is eligible for in dfsplayerrosterpositioneligibility - new sproc: UpdateRosterPositions
- create roster position eligibility repo
- web api should pass down list of all eligible positions: doesn't really need it in UI, but add to dao 
- create contains expression builder
- web api needs to filter on all eligible positions : now position column no longer matches position filter names, but that's OK!
darn logging is still broken - figure it out AGAIN - I give up and revert to the way it was before :-(, better to have logging than the annoyance of changing for dev
