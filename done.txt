-Restart done list on 7/17/2013:
x weather - show in UI :-)
x make sure webapi can deploy to 2012 and get geodata - set osfamily=3 and include sqlserver types dll
x hide weather and player game log if no data at all (like 7/17)
x clean up weather display, does time properly include minutes? better date format in title (leave out year), format probability
x only load weather for today forward (not all time)
x change date picker to not allow picking dates in the past
x how to exclude data from download in json - start using AutoMapper, mapping domain objects to DTOs
x more controller level code cleanup - remove unused actions, use enums, use JSONProperty, automapper
x fix in Firefox - ExtJS bug - fixed by setting default ajax headers for all ajax requests
