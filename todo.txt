more on projections: scrape more? or edit myself
move to generic projections table and key off of playerid/gameid (not week)

Roster Generation
==========
change code to use new salary table to get per/game

Misc.
==========
siteDetails store should only need to filter by gameId & not site id  
- Hadoop?
fix delete problem in azure: loops through every file even though it was not just copied, to find a source file to delete (after copy), take much longer than necessary
whenupdated table: increase tableName column/change column name : minor re-architect!
export top grid to csv
drag/drop to lineup list
more code cleanup - Fix SportPlayer return in WEBAPI use a datacontract resolver; don't assume NBA; fix generics 
some view models still in the data layer, move to view layer
theme
Add glossary
new scrapers: - fan throwdown, draftstreet, star street?
add venue information to game data
Figure out build process for Ext JS 4 - slow now!!
Add who's hot option; do some daily computation and put in db
should put a help bar icon on the toolbar in the filters with a popup to expain the section
need to check out project to new area -to make sure I can do everything I need to
create state manager for grids
more logging
upgrade generate schema script to capture pks and not null attributes!!!
why doesn't sitedetailsstore make ajax call when filtered()?
dealing with positions and mappings is still less than ideal
need to figure out how to deal with sites where player can play multiple positions (for position filters)
create team ui/drag + drop for players
Write a detailed document with information on all projects, deployments, accounts etc.
disable draftaid.com/twitter until ready
Attach domain name to wordpress site?
embed azure app within wordpress site?
start adding headers, logos, themes, affiliate links etc. to wordpress site
weather: schedule to retrieve it a little more often
- players that might need nickname mappings:
    select * from player p
    inner join fanduel f on (f.namelast = p.namelast)
    where  f.playerId = 0 and f.sportId = 1 and p.teamId >=255
    and positionId not in (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33)
    order by p.position desc;
another performance check on the webapi (rosterpositions takes too long to load)

Major Schema related:
=======
Change to support double headers
Convert all dates to UTC?
add support for multiple projection sets

UI:
==========
Possible ui improvements for roster position eligibility: show comma separated values in UI
much better icons for probable/likely/injured
weather display should be renamed, since it contains other game details
- new UI: plan for MLB season
sencha cmd
all game definitions pre-loaded 1x, instead of ajax calls for each change?
add time of update for starting lineup
add column with position played in bottom grid?
need glossary or tooltips for column headers
need player filters - use generic grid filters?
Change theme colors
Clean up header for bottom grid - full team name, full position name, other?
need reset filters button
need filter summary (or summaries?)
need to clear or set all games
need to be able to choose individual teams, not just games
uncheck games that have already occurred in the day on page load, and make not chooseable?
better way to configure bottom grid columns to be longer

ExtJS:
===========
save current state of filters etc.
check for fixes for extjs checkbox bug - STILL not fixed as of 4.2.1
Clean up theme
On stores, encodeFilters, encodeSorters are all copy-paste: Either create a common proxy for them to all use or fix the server side to accept the default sort and filter format generated by EXTJS (latter is preferable?)

WEBAPI:
===========
revisit all cached repos for code changes/cleanup - fix to not cache as a chunk?
schedule repository should have miss functionality and just load schedules for next week+
(Bill) Add Trace Logging and Save trace logs and iis logs to azure storage
Go through TODO comments in code

Loader/Data - generic:
===========
when local game id provided by site (fd/dd/dk) use an idmapping to get actual game id, could be important for double headers!!
deal with future days' contests and/or 2-day contests?
move quartz working code back into the WEBAPI solution and into a worker role
transactions!
Can replace Config::Tiny with something that normally ships with strawberry perl?
move nickname stuff to db!!
stop at collecting 1 feed file - just be smart and try to get the latest before copying - makes import take a long time to go through multiple
move some more generic stuff from bulkdataimporter to baseimporter, remove dependency of lineup importer on bulkdataimporter
save_to_db is unwieldy - clean it up?
- Nullable sportId in view, get not null to stick when updating edmx 

Loader/Data - baseball
===========
add backup to lineups script to look for other games from another site?
Clean up logging - don't exit on errors, just log and continue, use a logging api?
change load_teamrosters to ignore players that are already ok?
fantasyfeud might be easy to load data for: http://www.fantasyfeud.com/#draftkit.salaries
yahoo player matchups, match dejesus to de jesus? How
scrape of yahoo matchups ended up with 2 values for some players breaking the query - may need to revisit yahoo scrape
add flag to all scripts to prepare it for a reload of data, ex. when importing fanduel scores delete the pricing data
for fanduel for the current day from both the fanduel table and the dfspricing table.
whenupdated table: add column for sport

Perl/Azure (rdp password is P3rlUser):
============
- should change to worker role?
- new trace provider or new web.config version, so don't have to comment out azure diagnostics trace provider when running locally?
- figure out config problem in perl cloud project (11/15/2013 - is it gone?hasn't happened in a while)
(Bill) Add blob lease checking - when running from >1 instance, ensure only one instance runs
Fix cron trigger to compute UTC time, instead of hard-coding or switch to diff. trigger type
Move quartz jobs into the WEBAPI project?
(Bill) Figure out the best way to send the errors from the load scripts to me (email?) - note: currently running perl/azure scripts not checked in
Write file with db connection?
calling cpan.bat - any options that will make this faster, like skipping tests?
keep jobs (script lists and schedules) in a db table?
fix bad references when updating edmx file - runningperlinazure project

Maintenance:
===========
check db backups
back up schema and domain data and commit to git
upgrade to VS 2013
consolidate azure accounts, know which account stuff is under
add copyrights to all files
combine webapi and load projects into one github repo?
query to Find problems in mappings: select daId, srcName, count(*) from idmapping where tableName = 'player' group by daId, srcName having count(*) > 1;

MLB - leave until 2014:
=========
odds - add id mappings, test
stats grid pass 2 - genericise mlb/nba stats to match 
lineups for doubleheaders? 5/28/2012 - need to change filter to search on double headers (server side change :-()
- every once in  a while run this to update nicknames: select * from mlbplayer where playerId = 0 and activeSW = 'A';
- add pitchers info to game view
- need venue information: city, roofType, direction, then add wind direction
- show venue and show better indication of wind speed etc.
- problem with game ids of double headers in stats?
- aggregate stats for top grid: games played, avg mins over last n, avg pts over last n
- area for game info:
- betting line
- fix active flag on player - when they are in a starting lineup, probably means they just came off of the DL. This is not the query, but it's a start:
