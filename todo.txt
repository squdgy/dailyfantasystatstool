Write a detailed document with information on all projects, deployments, accounts etc.
disable draftaid.com/twitter until ready
Attach domain name to wordpress site
embed azure app within wordpress site?
start adding headers, logos, themes, affiliate links etc. to wordpress site

NBA:
=========
import roster every day?
deal with duplicate Chris Johnsons in NBA!!
dealing with positions and mappings is still less than ideal
upgrade generate schema script to capture pks and not null attributes!!!
siteDetails store should only need to filter by gameId & not site id

Misc.
==========
- Figure out build process for Ext JS 4 - slow now!!
Find weather data
Add who's hot option; do some daily computation and put in db
should put a help bar icon on the toolbar in the filters with a popup to expain the section
need to check out project to new area -to make sure I can do everything I need to
export top grid to csv
create state manager for grids
more logging
why doesn't sitedetailsstore make ajax call when filtered()?
Can't pick a player that has no stats yet, since they don't show up
need to figure out how to deal with sites where player can play multiple positions (for position filters)
create team ui/drag + drop for players

UI:
==========
lineups for doubleheaders? 5/28/2012 - need to change filter to search on double headers (server side change :-()
add time of update for starting lineup
add column with position played in bottom grid?
need glossary or tooltips for column headers
need player filters - use generic grid filters?
Change theme colors
Clean up header for bottom grid - full team name, full mlb position name, other?
need reset filters button
need filter summary (or summaries?)
hide players not known to be playing - shouldn't hide starting pitchers
need to clear or set all games
need to be able to sort by multiple columns
need to be able to choose individual teams, not just games
uncheck games that have already occurred in the day on page load, and make not chooseable?

ExtJS:
===========
Clean up theme
On stores, encodeFilters, encodeSorters are all copy-paste: Either create a
common proxy for them to all use or fix the server side to accept the default
  sort and filter format generated by EXTJS (latter is preferable?)

WEBAPI:
===========
Bug - game sometimes don't show up in games list even when players do (MLB)
(Bill) Add Trace Logging and Save trace logs and iis logs to azure storage

Loader/Data - generic:
===========
move quartz working code back into the WEBAPI solution and into a worker role
transactions!
Can replace Config::Tiny with something that normally ships with strawberry perl?
write some perl logic to not look for whenupdated when run locally

Loader/Data - baseball
===========
capuano showing as started on 5/9? tim hudson 5/23 - didn't pitch? - pitchers show up if they pinch hit - how to deal with this
add backup to lineups script to look for other games from another site?
probably need to double check probable pitchers filter for dailyjoust
recheck all stats against an external source - particularly games played and appearances for pitchers
Clean up logging - don't exit on errors, just log and continue, use a logging api?
create script to roll up player data?
2 Chris Carpenters - BOS player is in minors. - How to tell difference in data loader scripts, need fanduel teamid mapping table
change load_teamrosters to ignore players that are already ok?
fantasyfeud might be easy to load data for: http://www.fantasyfeud.com/#draftkit.salaries
yahoo player matchups, match dejesus to de jesus? How
scrape of yahoo matchups ended up with 2 values for some players breaking the query - may need to revisit yahoo scrape

Perl/Azure:
============
(Bill) Add blob lease checking - when running from >1 instance, ensure only one instance runs
Fix cron trigger to compute UTC time, instead of hard-coding or switch to diff. trigger type
Move quartz jobs into the WEBAPI project?
(Bill) Create some sort of deploy script (post-commit hook?) that will deploy the perl load scripts to blob storage
(Bill) Figure out the best way to send the errors from the load scripts to me (email?) - note: currently running perl/azure scripts not checked in
(Bill) Figure out how to transfer startup logs to storage - these are Perl logs, want to capture
Write file with db connection?
calling cpan.bat - any options that will make this faster, like skipping tests?
keep jobs (script lists and schedules) in a db table?

Maintenance:
===========
add copyrights to all files
combine webapi and load projects into one github repo?
